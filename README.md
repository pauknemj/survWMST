# survWMST
This package comtains functions to perform survival anaylsis using standard and versatile window mean survival time (WMST) methods.This is a work in progress which will continue to expand as new WMST methods are developed.

Currently, we have methods for:

- **Window Mean Survival Time** with `wmst()`, based on the work of Paukner et al. (2021) 
- **Versatile WMST** with `combo()`, based on the work of Paukner et al. (2022)
